# my toDo
Project developed in React with ContextAPI and TailwindCSS.


# What is supposed to be?
- This project is a simple toDo list app developed in ReactJS and only the frontend part of it

## Why does this exist?
- This project was developed as a technical challenge to test my skills with frontend development.


### Main concepts used in this project were:
- The chosen design approach was to use a responsive layout and focused on mobile screen.
- Divide every function, functionality or element into components to better arrange and segment the code.
- Don't be afraid to use multiple states and transform local states into global ones.
- Use of CSS frameworks to help the development and improve the appealingness, in this case I've used TailwindCSS.
- Develop business logic into a ```src/service``` folder.
- Name all folders and files in __```kebab-case```__, JSX classes in __```PascalCase```__ and JS functions in __```cammelCase```__.
